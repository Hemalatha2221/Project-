ðŸ’» CodSoft Internship Tasks - Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains the machine learning tasks completed during my internship at CodSoft. I've worked on various classification-based projects using Python and popular ML libraries. Below is a brief description of the completed tasks:

âœ… Task 1: Movie Genre Classification

Developed a machine learning model that predicts the genre of a movie based on its plot summary.
Techniques Used: TF-IDF for text representation
Algorithms: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM
Goal: Classify movies into genres using natural language processing (NLP).


âœ… Task 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection

Built a classification model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.
Dataset: Contains transaction details and labels for fraud detection
Techniques: Feature scaling, class balancing
Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree
Goal: Accurately classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.


âœ… Task 4: Spam SMS Detection

Created a text classification model to identify spam messages from legitimate ones.
Techniques Used: TF-IDF vectorization, NLP preprocessing
Algorithms: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression
Goal: Automatically detect and filter out spam SMS
